TERMS OF SERVICE

Flo Technologies, Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, “Flo”) provides, or may provide: (1) a Flo user account website that may be accessed at meetflo.com and meetflo.com sub-domains (each, a “Site”), and/or (2) services accessible through the Sites (“Web Apps”), and/or (3) software that may be downloaded to your smartphone or tablet to access services (“Mobile Apps”), and/or (4) subscription services, including services that can be accessed using the Web Apps and Mobile Apps (“Subscription Services”), all for use in conjunction with Flo hardware products (“Products”) and in other ways that Flo provides or may provide. Some Flo products and Services may be used together or in ways that may integrate with products and services from third parties. The term “Services” means the Sites, Web Apps, Mobile Apps, Subscription Services and Flo Customer Support.

These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the Services.  Please read these terms carefully. They require the use of binding arbitration to resolve disputes rather than jury trials or class actions. The term “you,” as used in these Terms, means any person or entity who accesses or uses the Services and any person or entity who creates an Account (as defined in Section 2(a)) and accepts these Terms, including Owners, Authorized Users (as those terms are defined in Section 2(b)), and the parents or guardians of Authorized Users, as applicable (as described in Section 1(b)(ii)). These Terms give you specific legal rights, and you may also have other legal rights in addition, which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The disclaimers, exclusions, and limitations of liability under these Terms will not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages or other rights, so those provisions of these Terms may not apply to you.

THIS IS A LEGAL AGREEMENT. BY ACKNOWLEDGING THE AGREEMENT OR BY ACCESSING AND USING THE SERVICES (INCLUDING THE SITES), YOU ARE ACCEPTING AND AGREEING TO THESE TERMS ON BEHALF OF YOURSELF OR THE ENTITY YOU REPRESENT IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACCESS. YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE THE RIGHT, AUTHORITY, AND CAPACITY (SUBJECT TO SECTION 1(b)(ii) BELOW) TO ACCEPT AND AGREE TO THESE TERMS ON BEHALF OF YOURSELF OR THE ENTITY YOU REPRESENT, OR IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY, YOU WILL BE PERSONALLY LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES RESULTING FROM A BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT. YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU EITHER HAVE EXCLUSIVE CONTROL OR EXCLUSIVE POSSESSION OVER THE PROPERTY ON WHICH THE WEB APPS OR MOBILE APPS ARE BEING INSTALLED.  YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU: (i) EITHER HAVE EXCLUSIVE CONTROL OR EXCLUSIVE POSSESSION OVER THE REAL PROPERTY ON WHICH THE PRODUCT IS BEING INSTALLED; (ii) AS THE OWNER OR THE PERSON IN POSSESSION OR CONTROL (WHETHER EXCLUSIVE, OR NOT) OF THAT REAL PROPERTY, HAVE THE RIGHT TO INSTALL THE PRODUCT ON THAT REAL PROPERTY; OR (iii) HAVE PERMISSION TO INSTALL THE PRODUCT FROM ALL PERSONS WHO OCCUPY THAT REAL PROPERTY OR WHOSE CONSENT TO INSTALL THE PRODUCT MAY OTHERWISE BE REQUIRED.   YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU ARE, SUBJECT TO SECTION 1(b)(ii) BELOW, OF SUFFICIENT LEGAL AGE IN YOUR JURISDICTION OR RESIDENCE TO USE OR ACCESS THE SERVICES AND TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT. FLO IS WILLING TO PROVIDE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO YOU ONLY UPON CONDITION THAT YOU ACCEPT ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ANY OF THE PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS, YOU SHOULD DISCONNECT YOUR PRODUCTS FROM YOUR ACCOUNT (AS DESCRIBED BELOW) AND CEASE ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICES.

AS DESCRIBED BELOW, YOU ARE CONSENTING TO AUTOMATIC SOFTWARE UPDATE OF THE SERVICES AND OF THE PRODUCTS CONNECTED TO THE SERVICES. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE, YOU SHOULD NOT USE THE SERVICES.

AS DESCRIBED BELOW, SECTIONS 4 AND 5 DESCRIBE IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS OF THE SERVICES, ESPECIALLY IN CONNECTION WITH LIFE SAFETY AND CRITICAL USES. PLEASE READ THESE DISCLOSURES CAREFULLY, AS YOU ARE ACKNOWLEDGING THEM AND ACCEPTING THEM.

Flo reserves the right to make changes to these Terms, so please review them often. We'll post notice of modifications to these Terms on this page. You should ensure that you have read and agree with our most recent Terms when you use the Services. Continued use of the Services following notice of such changes shall indicate your acknowledgment of such changes and agreement to be bound by the revised Terms. If you have any questions regarding these Terms, you can contact Flo by email at support@meetflo.com, or by phone at 1(844) MEET-FLO.

1. Overview, Eligibility, Customer Service, Term and Termination

(a)  Overview and Relation to Other Agreements. These Terms govern your use of the Services. Your Product is governed by the limited warranty provided with that Product (“Limited Warranty”) and may further be governed by the Product Terms & Conditions. The software embedded in the Product (and any updates thereto) (“Product Software”) is licensed and governed by the End User Licensing Agreement. Certain features of the Services may be subject to additional guidelines, terms, or rules, which will be posted on the Services in connection with such features. All additional guidelines, terms, or rules, and the Privacy Policy for Flo Websites, and the Privacy Statement for Flo Products and Services, are incorporated by reference into these Terms and you are agreeing to accept and abide by them by using the Services.

(b)  Eligibility. (i) You may use the Services only if you can form a binding contract with Flo (except subject to the provisions of clause (1)(b)(ii) below), and only if you are in compliance with these Terms and all applicable local, state/provincial, national, and international laws, rules, and regulations. Only individuals age 18 and older are permitted to act as Owners of Flo Accounts. (ii) If you are an Authorized User, you represent and warrant that you are over the age of 13, and in the event you are between the age of 13 and the age of majority in the jurisdiction where you reside, that you will only use the Services under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by these Terms. Any use or access to the Services by individuals under the age of 13 without supervision by an adult is strictly prohibited and is a violation of these Terms. The Services are not available to any users previously prohibited from using the Services by Flo.

(c)  Customer Service. If you have any questions or concerns regarding the Products, the Services, or these Terms, please contact Flo by email at support@meetflo.com, or by telephone at 1 (844) MEET-FLO.

(d)  Term and Termination. These Terms will remain in full force and effect so long as you continue to access or use the Services, or until terminated in accordance with the provisions of these Terms. At any time, Flo may (i) suspend or terminate your rights to access or use the Services, or (ii) terminate these Terms with respect to you if Flo in good faith believes that you have used the Services in violation of these Terms, including any incorporated guidelines, terms or rules, or you have failed to pay your service fee. If you transfer a Product to a new owner, your right to use the Services with respect to that Product automatically terminates, and the new owner will have no right to use the Product or Services under your Account (as described below) and will need to register for a separate Account with Flo.

(e)  Effect of Termination. Upon termination of these Terms, your Account and your right to use the Services will automatically terminate.

2. Accounts

(a)  Your Account.  To use the Services, you must register for a user account (“Account”) and provide certain information about yourself as prompted by the applicable registration form. You represent and warrant that: (a) all required registration information you submit is truthful and accurate; (b) you will maintain the accuracy of such information; and (c) your use of the Services does not violate any U.S. or other applicable law or regulation (e.g., you are not located in an embargoed country or are not listed as a prohibited or restricted party under applicable export control laws and regulations). You are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Account login information and for all activities that occur under your Account. You agree to use “strong” passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols) with your Account, and to maintain your password securely to prevent others from gaining access without your permission. You agree to immediately notify Flo of any unauthorized use, or suspected unauthorized use, of your Account or any other breach of security. Flo is not liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with the above requirements.

(b)  Owner; Authorized User.  The individual who creates an Account is the “Owner” of that Account and is the Owner of the Flo Products associated with that Account.  Individuals who are authorized to access an Owner’s Products and Services are “Authorized Users.”  Authorized Users may have the ability to use the Services and monitor and control the Products (for example, an Authorized User can change your settings and open or close your valve).  Authorized Users may also have the ability to view information (including personal information) and content across all of an Owner’s Products, Services, and third party connections (if any).  Authorized Users are responsible for their own actions in connection with the Products and Services, but Owner also hereby agrees to be fully responsible for all actions taken by Authorized Users relating to the Owner’s Products, Services and Account.  If you are an Owner who invites or enables an Authorized User, you acknowledge and agree that such Authorized User may subsequently invite or enable other Authorized Users with the same access and ability to use your Products and Services set out above.  As a result, if you are an Owner, you should authorize only those individuals that you trust to access your Account, Products, and Services.

3. Access to Services

(a)  Access and Use.  Subject to these Terms, Flo grants you a non-transferable, non-exclusive, right (without the right to sublicense) to access and use the Services by, if available (i) using the Web Apps in connection with, and solely for the purpose of, controlling and monitoring the Products you own or are authorized to control and monitor or otherwise accessing a service explicitly provided by Flo for your use (the “Permitted Purpose”), and/or (ii) installing and using the Mobile Apps solely on your own handheld mobile device (e.g., iPhone, iPad, or Android smartphone) and solely for the Permitted Purpose.

(b)  Automatic Software Updates.  Flo may from time to time develop patches, bug fixes, updates, upgrades and other modifications to improve the performance of the Services and/or the Product Software (“Updates”). These may be automatically installed without providing any additional notice or receiving any additional consent. You consent to this automatic update. If you do not want such Updates, your remedy is to terminate your Account and stop using the Services and the Product. If you do not terminate a previously created Account, you will receive Updates automatically. You acknowledge that you may be required to install Updates to use the Services and the Product and you agree to promptly install any Updates Flo provides. Your continued use of the Services and the Product is your agreement: (i) to these Terms with respect to the Services, and (ii) to the End User License Agreement with respect to updated Product Software.

(c)  Interface to Third-Party Products and Services.  Over time, Flo may provide the opportunity for you to interface the Products and Services to one or more third-party products and services, through and using the Services (“Third Party Products and Services”). You decide whether and with which Third-Party Products and Services you want to interface. Your explicit consent and authorization is required for this interface, and is revocable by you at any time. Once your consent is given for a particular Third-Party Product and Service, you agree that Flo may exchange information and data regarding you and your products, including your personal information, in order to enable the interface you have authorized. Once this information is shared with the particular Third-Party Product and Service, its use will be governed by the third party's privacy policy and not by Flo's privacy documentation. You acknowledge and agree that Flo makes no representation or warranty about the safety of any Third-Party Products or Services. Accordingly, Flo is not responsible for your use of any Third Party Product or Service or any personal injury, death, property damage (including, without limitation, to your home), or other harm or losses arising from or relating to your use of any Third Party Products or Services. You should contact the third party with any questions about their Third Party Products and Services.

(d)  Content.  Certain materials may be displayed or performed on the Services (including, but not limited to, text, graphics, articles, photographs, video, images, and illustrations (collectively, “Content”)). The Content also includes information that you and other users provide us in the course of using the Services (collectively, “User Submissions”), which we may use to provide, maintain and improve the Services. Some content may be visible to others (for example, the Service may allow you to upload, post, or otherwise share photographic content). You may also post feedback, comments, questions, or other information on the Sites. You are solely responsible for all Content that you upload, post, email, transmit, or otherwise disseminate using, or in connection with, the Services, or that you contribute in any manner to the Services; you represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary to do so, in the manner in which you contribute it; and you license to Flo all patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other proprietary rights in and to such Content for publication on the Service pursuant to these Terms. You shall abide by all copyright notices, trademark rules, information, and restrictions contained in any Content accessed through the Services, and shall not use, copy, reproduce, modify, translate, publish, broadcast, transmit, distribute, perform, upload, display, license, sell or otherwise exploit for any purposes whatsoever any Content or third party submissions or other proprietary rights not owned by you: (i) without the express prior written consent of the respective owners, and (ii) in any way that violates any third party right. Flo reserves the right to remove any Content from the Services at any time, for any reason (including, but not limited to, upon receipt of claims or allegations from third parties or authorities relating to such Content or if we are concerned that you may have breached the immediately preceding sentence), or for no reason at all.

(e)  Certain Restrictions.  The rights granted to you in these Terms are subject to the following restrictions: (i) you agree not to license, sell, rent, lease, transfer, assign, distribute, host, or otherwise commercially exploit the Services; (ii) you agree not to modify, make derivative works of, disassemble, reverse compile, or reverse engineer any part of the Product, the Product installation, or the Services; (iii) you agree not to access the Product and Services in order to build a similar or competitive service; (iv) except as expressly stated herein, no part of the Product, the Product installation, and Services may be copied, reproduced, distributed, republished, downloaded, displayed, posted, or transmitted in any form or by any means; (v) you agree not to upload, transmit, or distribute any computer viruses, worms, or any software intended to damage or alter a computer or communication network, computer, handheld mobile device, data, the Services, the Product, the Product Software, or any other system, device or property; (vi) you agree not to interfere with, disrupt, or attempt to gain unauthorized access to, the servers or networks connected to the Services or violate the regulations, policies, or procedures of such networks; (vii) you agree not to access (or attempt to access) any of the Services by means other than through the interface that is provided by Flo; and (viii) you agree not to remove, obscure or alter any proprietary rights notices (including copyrights and trademark notices) which may be contained in or displayed in connection with the Services. Any future release, update, or other addition to functionality of the Services shall be subject to these Terms.

(f)  Open Source.  Certain items of independent, third party code may be included in the Web Apps and/or Mobile Apps that are subject to the GNU General Public License (“GPL”) or other open source licenses (“Open Source Software”). The Open Source Software is licensed under the terms of the license that accompanies such Open Source Software. Nothing in these Terms limits your rights under, or grants you rights that supersede, the terms and conditions of any applicable end user license for such Open Source Software. In particular, nothing in these Terms restricts your right to copy, modify, and distribute such Open Source Software that is subject to the terms of the GPL.

(g)  Privacy.  Please review the Privacy Policy for Flo Web Sites and the Privacy Statement for Flo Products and Services. These documents describe practices regarding the information that Flo may collect from users of the Products and Services, including any Content or User Submissions.

(h)  Security.  Flo cares about the integrity and security of your personal information. However, Flo cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat our security measures or use your personal information for improper purposes. You acknowledge that you provide your personal information at your own risk.

(i)  Modification.  Flo reserves the right, at any time, to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Services or any part thereof with or without notice. You agree that Flo will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuance of the Services or any part thereof.

(j)  Access Outside Certain Countries.  Although the Sites are accessible worldwide, the Products and Services provided or accessed through or on the Sites are not available to all persons or in all countries. If you choose to access the Sites from outside the United States, you do so on your own initiative and you are solely responsible for complying with applicable local laws in your country. You understand and accept that the Sites are not designed for use outside the United States and some or all of the features of the Sites may not work or be appropriate for use in such a country. To the extent permissible by law, Flo accepts no responsibility or liability for any damage or loss caused by your accessing or use of the Sites, Flo Products or Services outside the United States. You will be bound by these Terms wherever you access or use the Sites or use the Services. Flo expressly prohibits the transfer of Products or Services to, or use of Products or Services by, any Office of Foreign Asset Control (“OFAC”) “Specially Designated National” or in any OFAC sanctioned Country.

(k)  Export/Import Control.  The Products, Services, and related technology are subject to U.S. export control laws and may be subject to export or import regulations in other countries. You agree to strictly comply with all such laws and regulations and acknowledge that you have the responsibility to obtain authorization to export, re-export, or import the Products, Product Software and related technology, as may be required. You will indemnify and hold Flo harmless from any and all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, fines, penalties, costs and expenses (including attorney’s fees) arising from or relating to any breach by you of your obligations under this section.

4. Agreed Usage and Limitations of Flo Services

(a)  Intended Use of Flo Services.  The Services are intended to be accessed and used for non-time-critical information and control of Flo Products. While we aim for the Services to be highly reliable and available, they are not intended to be reliable or available 100% of the time. The Services are subject to sporadic interruptions and failures for a variety of reasons beyond Flo’s control, including Wi-Fi intermittency, service provider uptime, mobile notifications and carriers, among others. You acknowledge these limitations and agree that Flo is not responsible for any damages allegedly caused by the failure or delay of the Services.  Flo makes no warranty whatsoever with respect to the accuracy of the data.

(b)  No Life-Safety or Critical Uses of the Services.  You acknowledge and agree that the Products and Services, whether standing alone or when interfaced with third-party products or services are not certified for emergency response. Flo makes no warranty or representation that use of the Products or Services with any third-party product or service will affect or increase any level of safety or limit damages to your home. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, WHETHER STANDING ALONE OR INTERFACED WITH THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, ARE NOT A THIRD-PARTY MONITORED EMERGENCY NOTIFICATION SYSTEM -- FLO WILL NOT DISPATCH EMERGENCY AUTHORITIES TO YOUR HOME IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY. YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT FLO IS NOT LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES TO YOUR HOME, ITS CONTENTS OR ANY PERSONS OR PETS.  In addition, the Flo Customer Care and Support contacts cannot be considered a lifesaving solution for people at risk in the home, and they are no substitute for emergency services. All life threatening and emergency events should be directed to the appropriate response services. You expressly acknowledge and agree that Flo is not liable for your, or any third party or emergency responders, actions or failure to act in response to information acquired from the Products or Services. You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to educate yourself about how to respond to the information provided by the Products and Services and to respond according to the specifics of your situation.

(c)  Reliability of Notifications.  You acknowledge that the Services, including remote access and mobile notifications, are not intended to be 100% reliable or 100% available. We cannot and do not guarantee that you will receive notifications in any given time or at all. YOU AGREE THAT YOU WILL NOT RELY ON THE SERVICES FOR ANY LIFE SAFETY OR CRITICAL PURPOSES. MOBILE NOTIFICATIONS REGARDING THE STATUS AND ALARMS ON YOUR FLO PRODUCTS ARE PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY – THEY ARE NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR A THIRD-PARTY MONITORED EMERGENCY NOTIFICATION SYSTEM. The information provided by Flo on what to do in an emergency is based on authoritative safety sources, but there is no way for Flo to provide specific information relating to a situation in your home or elsewhere. You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to educate yourself about how to respond to an emergency and to respond according to the specifics of your situation.

(d)  Temporary Suspension.  The Services may be suspended temporarily without notice for security reasons, system failure, maintenance and repair, or other circumstances. You agree that you will not be entitled to any refund or rebate for such suspensions. Flo does not offer any specific uptime guarantee for the Services.

(e)  System Requirements.  The Services will not be accessible without: (i) a working Wi-Fi network in your home that is positioned to communicate reliably with the Products; (ii) an Account; (iii) mobile clients such as a supported phone or tablet (required for some functionality); (iv) always-on broadband Internet access in your home with bandwidth sufficient to support the Products you use; and (v) other system elements that may be specified by Flo. It is your responsibility to ensure that you have all required system elements and that they are compatible and properly configured. You acknowledge that the Services may not work as described when the requirements and compatibility have not been met. In addition, you acknowledge that Flo may activate ZigBee (or other local communication protocol) on your smartphone or tablet, with or without prior notification, in order to facilitate proper operation of the Services, enable communication with Flo Products connected to the same Flo account, and enable certain features.

(f)  Water Savings and other Benefits.  Unless explicitly promising a “guarantee,” Flo does not guarantee or promise any specific level of water savings, accuracy of water data, insurances discounts, rebates, or other monetary benefit from the use of the Products or Services or any feature of them. Actual water savings, water usage and monetary benefits vary with factors beyond Flo’s control or knowledge. From time to time, Flo may use the Services to provide you with information that is unique to you and/or your water usage and suggests an opportunity to save money if you adopt suggestions or features of the Product or Services. We do this to highlight an opportunity based on our analysis and information about you and your household. You acknowledge that these promotions are not a guarantee of actual savings, and you agree not to seek monetary or other remedies from Flo if your savings differ. You acknowledge that use of the Products or Services or any feature of them alone will not provide any monetary or other benefit to you. You expressly acknowledge and agree that use of the Products or Services or any feature of them is at your sole risk and that the entire risk as to satisfactory quality, performance, accuracy and effort is with you.

(g)  Product Information.  The Services provide you information (“Product Information”) regarding the Products in your home and their connection with other products and services. All Product Information is provided “as is” and “as available”. We cannot guarantee that it is correct or up to date. In cases where it is critical, accessing Product Information through the Services is not a substitute for direct access of the information in the home. You expressly acknowledge that Flo is not liable for your or any other third party’s response, or lack thereof, to the Product Information or lack thereof. You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to educate yourself about how to interpret and respond to the Product Information.

(h)  Responsibility for Content.  All information publicly posted or privately transmitted through the Services is the sole responsibility of the person from which (or from whose account) such Content originated and Flo will not be liable for any errors or omissions in any Content. Flo cannot guarantee the identity of any other users with whom you may interact in the course of using the Services. Additionally, we cannot guarantee the authenticity of any data that users or merchants may provide about themselves. You acknowledge that all Content accessed by you using the Services is at your own risk and you will be solely responsible for any damage or loss to any party resulting therefrom. We cannot control and have no duty to take any action regarding how you may interpret and use the Content or what actions you may take as a result of having been exposed to the Content, and you hereby release us from all liability for you having acquired or not acquired Content through the Services.

(i)  Your Warranty Regarding Your Content and Use of Services.  You warrant, represent and agree that you will not contribute any Content or otherwise use the Services in a manner that (i) infringes or violates the intellectual property rights or proprietary rights, rights of publicity or privacy, or other rights of any third party; (ii) violates any law, statute, ordinance or regulation; (iii) is harmful, fraudulent, deceptive, threatening, abusive, harassing, tortious, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, libelous, or otherwise objectionable; (iv) impersonates any person or entity, including without limitation any employee or representative of Flo; (v) contains a virus, Trojan horse, worm, time bomb, or other harmful computer code, file, or program; (vi) jeopardizes the security of your Flo Account or anyone else’s Account (such as allowing someone else to log in to the Services as you); (vii) attempts, in any manner, to obtain the password, account, or other security information from any other user; (viii) violates the security of any computer network, or cracks any passwords or security encryption codes; (ix) runs Maillist, Listserv, or any form of auto-responder or “spam” on the Services, or any processes that otherwise interfere with the proper working of the Services (including by placing an unreasonable load on the Services’ infrastructure); (x) copies or stores any significant portion of the Content; or (xi) decompiles, reverse engineers, or otherwise attempts to obtain the source code or underlying ideas or information of or relating to the Services.

(j)  Data Protection and Privacy Laws.  Data protection and privacy laws where you live may impose certain responsibilities on you and your use of the Products and Services. You agree that you (and not Flo) are responsible for ensuring that you comply with any applicable laws when you use the Products and Services.

5. Limitations of Flo Services Due to Third Parties.

(a)  General.  Flo Services may rely on or interoperate with third party products and services. These third party products and services are beyond Flo’s control, but their operation may impact or be impacted by the use and reliability of the Flo Services. You acknowledge and agree that: (i) the use and availability of the Services may be dependent on third party product vendors and service providers, (ii) these third party products and services may not operate in a reliable manner 100% of the time, and they may impact the way that the Flo Services operate, and (iii) Flo is not responsible for damages and losses due to the operation of these third party products and services.

(b)  Third Party Service Providers Used By Flo.  You acknowledge that Flo uses third party service providers to enable some aspects of the Services – such as, for example, data storage, synchronization, and communication through Amazon Web Services, and mobile device notifications through mobile operating system vendors and mobile carriers. YOU AGREE NOT TO RELY ON THE SERVICES FOR ANY LIFE SAFETY OR TIME-CRITICAL PURPOSES.

(c)  Equipment, ISP, and Carrier.  You acknowledge that the availability of the Services is dependent on: (i) your computer, mobile device, home wiring, home Wi-Fi network, ZigBee (or other local communication protocol) connection, and other related equipment (“Equipment”), (ii) your Internet service provider (“ISP”), and (iii) your mobile device carrier (“Carrier”). You acknowledge that you are responsible for all fees charged by your ISP and Carrier in connection with your use of the Services. You also acknowledge that you are responsible for compliance with all applicable agreements, terms of use/service, and other policies of your ISP and Carrier.

(d)  Third Party Products and Services that Work With Flo Services.  Flo may provide the opportunity for you to interface to Third Party Products and Services. You acknowledge that Third Party Products and Services that you connect to your account or interface with are not Flo products and services and you acknowledge and agree that Flo does not control, and that these Terms do not apply to, any Third Party Products and Services. Use of any Third Party Products and Services is governed by separate terms and conditions provided by the operator(s) of the applicable Third Party Products and Services. You acknowledge and agree that Flo makes no representation or warranty about the operation, reliability, or safety of any Third Party Products or Services. Accordingly, Flo is not responsible for your use of any Third Party Product or Service or any personal injury, death, property damage (including, without limitation, to your home), interruption of service, downtime, data loss, or other harm or losses arising from or relating to your use of any Third Party Products or Services. You should contact the Third Party with any questions about their products and services.

(e)  App Stores.  You acknowledge and agree that the availability of the Mobile Apps is dependent on the third party websites from which you download the Mobile Apps, e.g., the App Store from Apple or the Android app market from Google (each an “App Store”). You acknowledge that these Terms are between you and Flo and not with an App Store. Each App Store may have its own terms and conditions to which you must agree before downloading Mobile Apps from it. You agree to comply with, and your license to use the Mobile Apps is conditioned upon your compliance with, such App Store terms and conditions. To the extent such other terms and conditions from such App Store are less restrictive than, or otherwise conflict with, the terms and conditions of these Terms, the more restrictive or conflicting terms and conditions in these Terms apply.

(f)  Third Party Website Links and Referrals.  The Sites may contain links to other web sites operated by third parties (“Third Party Sites”) and referrals to third party vendors (“Referred Vendors”). Such Third Party Sites and Referred Vendors are not under our control. Flo provides these links and referrals only as a convenience and does not review, approve, monitor, endorse, warrant, or make any representations with respect to such Third Party Sites or Referred Vendors. Your use of these Third Party Sites or Referred Vendors is at your own risk.

(g)  Authorized Users.  Flo is not responsible for any Authorized User’s behavior, or for any personal injury, death, property damage (including, without limitation, to your home), or other harm or losses arising from or relating to their use of the Services.

(h)  Release Regarding Third Parties.  Flo is not responsible for third parties or their products and services, including, without limitation, the App Stores, Third Party Products and Services, Third Party Sites, Referred Vendors, Equipment, ISPs, and Carriers. Flo hereby disclaims and you hereby discharge, waive and release Flo and its licensors and suppliers from any past, present, and future claims, liabilities, and damages, known or unknown, arising out of or relating to your interactions with such third parties and their products and services. YOU HEREBY WAIVE CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SECTION 1542 IN CONNECTION WITH THE FOREGOING, WHICH STATES: “A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.” YOU HEREBY WAIVE ANY SIMILAR PROVISION IN ANY OTHER JURISDICTION.

6. Ownership and Intellectual Property

(a)  Flo Property.  You acknowledge that all intellectual property rights, including without limitation copyrights, patents, trademarks, and trade secrets, in the Product, Product Software, and Services (i.e., the Sites, Web Apps, and Mobile Apps) are owned by Flo or its affiliates or our licensors. Your possession, access, and use of the Product, Product Software, and Services do not transfer to you or any third party any rights, title, or interest in or to such intellectual property rights. Flo and its affiliates and licensors and suppliers reserve all rights not granted in these Terms. The Services are licensed to you, not sold, under these Terms.

You may only copy parts of the Services (including the Sites) on to your own computer for your own personal use. You may not use the content of the Services in any other public or commercial way nor may you copy or incorporate any of the content of the Services into any other work, including your own web site without the written consent of Flo.

By submitting any Ideas, you agree that your submissions are voluntary, gratuitous, unsolicited, and without restriction and will not place Flo under any fiduciary or other obligation. Flo may use, copy, modify, publish, or redistribute the submission and its contents for any purpose and in any way without any compensation to you. You also agree that Flo does not waive any rights to use similar or related ideas previously known to Flo, developed by its employees, or obtained from other sources.

(c)  User Submissions.

You also hereby do and shall grant each user of the Services a non-exclusive license to access and use your User Submissions through the Services and as permitted through the functionality of the Services and under these Terms. Furthermore, you understand that we retain the right to reformat, modify, create derivative works of, excerpt, and translate any User Submissions submitted by you.

10. Service Fees and Payment

(a)  Service Fees.  To use the Services, you must pay all applicable fees in connection with the Services selected by you (“Service Fees”) in accordance with these Terms.

(b)  Continuous Subscriptions.  If you purchase any of our Services, you expressly acknowledge and agree that: (1) Flo is authorized to charge you a monthly or annual subscription service fee depending on the billing cycle you choose (in addition to any applicable taxes) for as long as your subscription continues, and (2) your subscription is continuous until you cancel it or such Subscription Service is suspended, discontinued or terminated in accordance with these Terms.

(c)  Billing.  We automatically bill the payment method associated with your Flo account on a monthly or annual basis (depending on the billing cycle you choose). Day one of your billing cycle is tied to the date you activate your Services by pairing them to Product, and/or installing the Product. You acknowledge that the amount billed may vary due to promotional offers, changes in your Subscription Services plan and changes in applicable taxes, and you authorize us to charge your payment method for the corresponding amounts.

(d)  Cancellations and Refunds.  You may cancel your Services at any time by contacting customer support by email at support@meetflo.com, or by telephone at 1 (844) MEET-FLO.

In the event you cancel a Service, we will provide a prorated refund for the period of time starting the day after cancellation of the Subscription Service through the remainder of your billing cycle.

11. Arbitration Agreement

PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY.

(a)  Agreement to Arbitrate Disputes.  Except as provided in Section 13(b), below, you and Flo agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating in any way to the Products and/or Services, these Terms, the Product Terms and Conditions, the Limited Warranty, the End User License Agreement and this Arbitration Agreement, shall be determined by binding arbitration. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. You agree that, by agreeing to these Terms, the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and Flo are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement and the termination of your Flo Services.

(b)  Arbitration Notice.  If you elect to seek arbitration, you must first send to Flo, by certified mail, a written notice of your claim ("Arbitration Notice"). The Arbitration Notice to Flo must be addressed to: Flo Legal Department, 3750 Robertson Blvd., Suite 202, Culver City, CA 90232 ("Arbitration Notice Address"). If Flo initiates arbitration, it will send a written Arbitration Notice to the email address used for your Flo account. An Arbitration Notice, whether sent by you or by Flo, must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). If Flo and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Arbitration Notice is received, you or Flo may commence an arbitration proceeding.

(c)   Filing Fees.  You may download or copy a form Arbitration Notice and a form to initiate arbitration at www.adr.org. If you are required to pay a filing fee, after Flo receives Arbitration Notice at the Arbitration Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration, Flo will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US$10,000, in which event you will be responsible for filing fees.

(d)   American Arbitration Association.  The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and Forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Arbitration Notice Address. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement. Except as provided in Section 13(b), below, all issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement. Unless Flo and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in Los Angeles, California.

(e)  Telephonic/In-Person Hearing.  If your claim is for US$10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds US$10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. If the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Flo’s last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected (or if Flo did not make a settlement offer before an arbitrator was selected), then Flo will pay you the amount of the award or US$1,000, whichever is greater. Except as expressly set forth herein, the payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.

(f)  Claims Only In Individual Capacity.  YOU AND FLO AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Flo agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.  If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this subsection’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.

(g)  Changes to Arbitration Agreement.  If Flo makes any changes to this Arbitration Agreement in these Terms (other than a change to the address at which Flo will receive Arbitration Notices or rejections of future changes to this Arbitration Agreement), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Flo Legal Department, 3750 Robertson Blvd., Suite 202, Culver City, CA 90232.  By rejecting a future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this Arbitration Agreement, as modified by any changes you did not reject.

13. General

(a)  Governing Law and Jurisdiction.  These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of California without giving effect to any conflict of laws principles that may provide the application of the law of another jurisdiction.
